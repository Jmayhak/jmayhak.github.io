  <p>
  I am an application developer. Since graduating from USC in 2009 I've worked to develop
  web applications for Clemson University, Reachsmart Interactive, Servant Interactive,
  Chernoff Newman, Trident Technical College, and LocoMotor Technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
  I try to be technology agnostic and pick the right tool for the job, however, I usually
  use PHP and Javascript.
  </p>

  <p>
  Grubbly is a consumer facing web, iPhone, and Android application for discovering
  local, static food and drink specials such as dollar pizza nights. It was developed by
  myself and <a href="http://jsndev.net">Jason Rikard</a>. There is a backend
  management area used by site admins such as myself and a merchant area for restaurants.
  </p>
  <p>
  The web portion was built with PHP and MySQL. The iPhone app is native and the Android app
  was built with web technologies/PhoneGap.
  </p>
  <p>
  The project is currently dormant but not finished. Stay tuned...

  <p>
  I was the lead developer on a curriculum development tool while employed by
  Servant Interactive called the Lesson Designer (LD). The LD is a web application
  that allows writers, editors, and designers to create lessons for the Servant
  Platform (codesk). Some of the functionality available to users of the LD:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add narration (via iSpeech API) to a lesson's content</li>
    <li>
    Insert various activities into a lesson such as guided tours of images,
    flashcards, word searches, timelines, click to reveal boxes, tracing,
    and images with labels that can be dragged or clicked to reveal.
    </li>
    <li>
    Ability to publish thousands of lessons a time to the iPad application and
    web application for viewing by end users.
    </li>
    <li>
    Lessons are packaged up for offline use on publish. This includes videos,
    images, fonts, audio clips, audio narration, and all activities.
    </li>
    <li>
    On publish a lesson goes the a "Media Optimization Process" to put all
    assets on a CDN and optimize the media to help lessons load as fast as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
    Ability to clone a lesson from one content provider to another.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Trata (LocoMotor Technologies; Columbia, SC)</h3>

  <p>
  <a href="http://tratanow.com">Trata</a> is a web application for discovering time senstive deals. Merchants have
  access to a portal that allows them to generate vouchers various deals that can
  then be claimed by end users. Site Admins can manage all deals from a seperate
  backend area.
  </p>

  <h3>Bluegill (Reachsmart Interactive; Columbia, SC)</h3>
  <p>
  Bluegill is a web application for managing and reporting on incentive-based advertising
  promotions. That is - ads that have a path users follow to get to various ads. At that
  point purchasing available products gives the user points that qualify him or her
  for different rewards.
  </p>
  <p>
  Bluegill allowed members of the business development team to control many aspects of
  the "path". This includes the available input fields on the registration form, the order
  of the path (landing page -> registration page -> ad 1 -> ad 2 -> ads for points), and
  the location of ads on the ads for points page (the CPA wall). The location of ads had
  both manual and auto placement. The auto placement would order the ads based on
  performance.
  </p>
  <p>
  As would be expected, there was also extensive reporting. Available metrics included
  clicks, impressions, gross revenue, net margin, and their derivatives. Metrics are viewed
  in aggragate by published and can be drilled down to see how each specific ad is
  performing. All metrics can be filtered by gender and date.

  <h3>Webneers & EFNEP (Clemson University's Youth Learning Institute; Pickens, SC)</h3>
  <p>
  The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) is a web application used by
  institues in all 50 states and the federal government to collect and report on data from
  adults and youth groups who are eligable for low income programs such as SNAP.
  The application is a 3-tiered reporting program where data flow up from regions
  to institues and finally to the federal level. The <a href="https://www.webneers.net/documents/manual.pdf">User Manual</a>
  is available online.
  </p>

  <h3>Low Country Foodways Project (Trident Technical College; North Charleston, SC)</h3>
  <p>
  As a contractor, I developed a reporting interface to help researchers find papers related to
  Lowcountry (a region of South Carolina) food and the paper's associated institution.
  </p>

  <h3>Bible.us & verselink (LifeChurch; Edmund, OK)</h3>
  <p>
  Developed a script named verselink that can be loaded on any site (via a bookmarklet or by the site admin)
  that searches all text on the site for bible references and turns them into links to
  <a href="http://bible.com">bible.com</a>.
