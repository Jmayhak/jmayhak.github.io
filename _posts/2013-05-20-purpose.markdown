<p>Not sure how you ended up here, but I'm glad you're here. If you need to contact me, the best way is via email <a href="mailto:hello@jonathanmayhak.com">hello@jonathanmayhak.com<&#47;a></p>
<p>Onto the purpose of this website. Everyone who creates things for a living needs to have their own website. Everyone. The website needs to be the&Acirc;&nbsp;authoritative source on what you want the internet to know about you and your business. And remember: you're not a business man. You're a business, man.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;grubbly.com" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-14" alt="Grubbly" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonathanmayhak.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;05&#47;unnamed.png" width="124" height="124" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>I have not had a centralized location to share my&Acirc;&nbsp;<em>amazing<&#47;em> opinions or announce projects such as <a title="Grubbly" href="http:&#47;&#47;grubbly.com" target="_blank">grubbly.com<&#47;a>&Acirc;&nbsp;in my whole internet history. I end that today. The basic&Acirc;&nbsp;purpose of this website is to get my personality and technical strengths&Acirc;&nbsp;across&Acirc;&nbsp;to future bosses, partners, friends, and clients. This website exists to give those internet&Acirc;&nbsp;stalking me an all-you-can-eat buffet. I'd rather have you flipping through this website, then all my photos on facebook. I'll save you the trouble and show you <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;photo.php?fbid=504138421510&amp;set=t.110900284&amp;type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">the most&Acirc;&nbsp;embarrassing photo of myself that's made it to the internet<&#47;a>. You're welcome.</p>
<p>When someone adds me on linkedin or twitter, one of the first things I do is google their name. I want to see if they have a website I can click through to learn more. I want to know if they like wake surfing as much as me. I want to know how they feel about taking pictures of&Acirc;&nbsp;themselves or their coffee. I want to figure out if I could learn something from this person.</p>
<p>I've been a hypocrite. I've expected this from everyone else but myself. It's hard to keep up with a blog&#47;website, so I've put it off. I don't hold anything against you if you don't have the time to post random articles on the internet. I've been there. Let's do this together.</p>
