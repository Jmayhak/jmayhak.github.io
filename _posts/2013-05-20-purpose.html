<p>Not sure how you ended up here, but I'm glad you're here. If you need to contact me, the best way is via email <a href="mailto:hello@jonathanmayhak.com">hello@jonathanmayhak.com</a></p>
<p>Onto the purpose of this website. Everyone who creates things for a living needs to have their own website. Everyone. The website needs to be the authoritative source on what you want the internet to know about you and your business. And remember: you're not a business man. You're a business, man.</p>
<p><a href="http://grubbly.com" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-14" alt="Grubbly" src="/images/unnamed.png" width="124" height="124" /></a></p>
<p>I have not had a centralized location to share my <em>amazing</em> opinions or announce projects such as <a title="Grubbly" href="http://grubbly.com" target="_blank">grubbly.com</a> in my whole internet history. I end that today. The basic purpose of this website is to get my personality and technical strengths across to future bosses, partners, friends, and clients. This website exists to give those internet stalking me an all-you-can-eat buffet. I'd rather have you flipping through this website, then all my photos on facebook. I'll save you the trouble and show you <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=504138421510&amp;set=t.110900284&amp;type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">the most embarrassing photo of myself that's made it to the internet</a>. You're welcome.</p>
<p>When someone adds me on linkedin or twitter, one of the first things I do is google their name. I want to see if they have a website I can click through to learn more. I want to know if they like wake surfing as much as me. I want to know how they feel about taking pictures of themselves or their coffee. I want to figure out if I could learn something from this person.</p>
<p>I've been a hypocrite. I've expected this from everyone else but myself. It's hard to keep up with a blog/website, so I've put it off. I don't hold anything against you if you don't have the time to post random articles on the internet. I've been there. Let's do this together.</p>
