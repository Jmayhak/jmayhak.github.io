<p>Starting a new work day can be a difficult start up process. It's similar to working out a difficult problem in your head and then a coworker distracts you. You will, of course, lose your place and begin again working out the difficult problem. When you start a new work day, you have to figure out where you left off.</p>

<p>I have found that the first few hours of the day 6-8am or 9-11pm are my most productive. It's not that I fail to get stuff done from 8-5, but then you have the distraction of everything else. After you've finished helping fellow employees, attended various meetings, and talked about the previous days baseball game you've only had a chance to get a few hours of "actual" work done. I put actual in quotes because those things are important, but they're not the tasks that you check off in your project management app. The things that prove to management that you're bringing value.</p>
<p>In order to start your day off right I recommend the following at the end of the previous day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean up your work area at the end of day. You can keep clutter going throughout the day, but put it back where it belongs when the day ends</li>
<li>Close all your open apps on your computer.</li>
<li>Write down everything you accomplished.</li>
<li>Write down exactly what you want to accomplish the next day. Include helpful notes to yourself if you'll be continuing a task from the previous day. This is extremely helpful for programming related tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take time at the end of today to make tomorrow better.</p>
