<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p><strong><a style="line-height: 13px;" href="http://www.bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a></strong><strong></strong>: [include image of my journal] The Bullet Journal is a great way to keep track of what you've accomplished or need to accomplish in an analog way. I prefer to write things down on paper.<br />
whiteboard: [include image of whiteboard] Sometimes, I like to sit back, draw up the big picture, and get my thoughts in order.<br />
27" Dell IPS: One of the best investments I've made is a large IPS monitor.<br />
Das Keyboard: I have the blue keys and no markings. I like this keyboard fine, but I actually prefer the full size apple keyboard.<br />
HD Webcam: If you work from home, then you should have a quality microphone and webcam. This webcam's microphone works very well.<br />
clean workspace: At the end of everyday, clear off your workspace. Start every day with a clean slate.<br />
No overhead lights: Overhead lights give me headaches. I like the work in the dark.<br />
Lenovo Yoga: [include link to article] This laptop works well for mobile work.<br />
Linode: My preferred VPS</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>phpstorm: Arguably the best editor right out of the box for PHP development. In fact, Jetbrains won't let you down with any of its products.<br />
mysql workbench &amp; heidisql: mysql workbench has a great database design tool and an import/export tool that works reliably. HeidiSQL is just a joy to use. It's much easier to run a quick query than mysql workbench.<br />
cmdr: gives you some of the goodies from bash like ssh.<br />
microsoft office 2013: outlook, word, and excel still top the best of list for office apps.<br />
notepad++: my go to light weight editor.<br />
vim: my go to editor when I'm on a server<br />
cloudberry s3 explorer pro: if you use s3 for asset hosting, I recommend this app for managing your s3 account.</p>
<p>filezilla: not pretty or especially unique, but it gets the job done when it comes to FTP/SFTP, etc.<br />
gimp: I rarely need to modify or create an image, but this app works for me.<br />
sourcetree: my preferred gui for working with git<br />
bitbucket: my preferred web app for hosting git repos<br />
rdio: I've never seriously used mog or spotify, but rdio looks amazing and has never let me down.<br />
chrome developer tools: IE has come a long way over the last few years and firebug is still great, but I'm most comfortable with chrome's developer tools.<br />
vagrant/virtualbox: local environment done right. You can match a production server much better than using xampp or mamp and your server configuration can be source controlled.<br />
composer: define your required projects, source control the list, live yo life.<br />
laravel 4: if I get a choice on framework, I'd likely pick lavavel 4.</p>
