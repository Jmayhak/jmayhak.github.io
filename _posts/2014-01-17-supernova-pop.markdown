<p>At the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;hackathon.sparcedge.com&#47;">SPARC Hackathon 2013<&#47;a>&nbsp;this year Jason Rikard and I created <a href="https:&#47;&#47;itunes.apple.com&#47;us&#47;app&#47;supernova-pop&#47;id705934287?mt=8">Supernova Pop<&#47;a>. This hackathon is based around a given theme and 16 hours to create something in the mobile space. Our theme was space, so naturally we made a space game. After the 16 hours was up, we had probably worked on the app for 10 hours each after accounting for sleep, lunch, breakfast, and zoning out. It should be noted that neither of us have made a game before and neither of us develop for the iPhone as our day job.</p>
<p>We placed in the top 10 out of 30 teams and that allowed us to present our game in front of the other teams + attendees. At the time, the app was mostly how it is now with no sound, no ads, no gamecenter, no multiplier, and some other visual improvements. Our goal was to create a fully functioning game; many hackathon groups create apps that are just illusions or simple proofs-of-concept.</p>
<p>Check the app out and let us know what you think! Also, if you're a developer, I highly recommend you sign up for the SPARC Hackathon 2014.</p>
